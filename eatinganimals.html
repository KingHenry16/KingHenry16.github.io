Eating Animals - Henry

1. There is text at the top that always says "“When the planetary crisis matters to us at all, it has the quality of a war being fought over there. We are aware of the existential stakes and the urgency, but even when we know that a war for our survival is raging, we don’t feel immersed in it. That distance between awareness and feeling can make it very difficult for even thoughtful and politically engaged people—people who want to act— to act.” — Jonathan Safron Foer, We Are The Weather
99% of all land animals eaten or used to produce milk and eggs in the United States are factory farmed. So although there are important exceptions, to speak about eating animals today is to speak about factory farming. — Jonathan Safron Foer, Eating Animals"

2. There is a div of a woman's face from above, and a menu.

3. When you click the menu, it runs a math random from 1-10 (?) and then it sends a message to other divs to either show up or stay hidden depending on what number it sends out.
