<h3>Week 1: In the first few classes of CS1 we looked over what divs and html were, and looked at our first assignment, person cards. We then saw Molly’s website that contained divs. We also talked about how Molly has this super cool podcast called this teenage life. We then had to make a getting to know you lab. I am excited for this year in CS1!
</h3>

<h3>Week 2: Still pretty introductory stuff, we talked about the projects we will be doing later this semester. I had my getting to know you lab with Molly, and went over my person card.
</h3>

<h3>Week 3: We finished up our person cards and then put them onto Molly’s website so people can have links to our websites that we will make in the future. We also started on little website diddies that are like simple, little games or fun things to do. I wanted to make mine about a dog that swirls and gets bigger when you hover, and a basketball that does a 360 when you hover over it.
</h3>

<h3>Week 4: I thought more about my website diddies and decided I wanted to make my basketball diddy into a bigger game that could be one of my main projects for this term. I added a feature with Molly’s help that made the ball follow your cursor. I also wanted to try and figure out how to have the dog play a sound when it was hovered over.
</h3>

<h3>Week 5: I tried to do more on my basketball game where it would give a value to how long the cursor was held using event listener in JavaScript. This would later help me to set how far the ball goes based on this value. I pretty much want a game where however long you hold you mouse that’s the power of the shot, and your cursor determines the angle at which it is released. The thing I realized about coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is that I don’t really have the  language to do what I want with my website. I think if I could just tell my website what I wanted it to do I could accomplish a lot more. For the time being it is difficult to code at home, and without Molly’s help.
</h3>

<h3>Week 6: We learned that one of our big projects is going to be turning a room with no purpose into an awesome room with a lot of different games and interactive features. Coding at home is still a struggle. </h3>

<h3>Week 7: We started work on our personal websites, as well as making sketches for what we think would be fun to have in the room.</h3>

<h3>Week 8: I made a very helpful lab with Molly and we set up my personal website which looks AWESOME!! In fact, you are reading this on my website right now… do you like it?
</h3>

<h3>Week 9: We were introduced to scratch. Some people had already with it, others had not. There was also a variety of opinions about scratch good/bad. Personally, I love it. Yeah, the sprites are kinda goofy and I wish there were some better ways to maneuver the code, but to be honest it is so much easier and more fun to work on my projects. I can just experiment with a lot of different things on my own, because all the words make sense in my head. There is not much you would need to know specifically to understand what is going on. I got to work on a new basketball game that has my original idea in mind. I made a really cool start which I think can definitely be refined and the style and details could look better, but overall it is really awesome.
